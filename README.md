# Guess-My-Number

Author: Victor Hugo Santos Aguiar (@vhugoaguiar)

## Overview

This JavaScript project represents my first venture into web development, showcasing my skills in DOM manipulation. It is based on the "Guess My Number" app from Udemy's course, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann, but with my personal touch in program logic and code refactoring.

## Project Description

- **Objective:** Guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.
- **User Interaction:** Input your guess and receive feedback on whether it's too high, too low, or correct.
- **Dynamic UI:** The user interface is updated dynamically using DOM manipulation to reflect the game state.

## Notable Features

- **Enhanced Game Logic:** Personalized logic to improve and customize the gaming experience.
- **Code Refactoring:** The original code has been refactored for improved readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
